Freedom Cash Lenders

Unlike federal student loans, there is not a single website that contains information about all your private student loans. The lender or servicer for each of your loans should provide you with information on how, when, and to whom to pay. This can come in the form of a monthly email, or a billing statement sent to you by mail each month. Some lenders provide a “welcome kit” or phone call when a borrower enters repayment.

To find information on your private student loans, contact each of your private student loan servicers to determine your total loan balance. The current noteholder, if different from the servicer you send regular payments to, should also have information specific to your loan. The noteholder is the entity who owns your loan. For private loans, that would be the direct lender.

If you don’t know who your private student loan servicers are, it should be listed on your original loan paperwork, such as a promissory note or disbursement notice.
