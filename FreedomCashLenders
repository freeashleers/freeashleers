Last month, we published a report on student loan affordability, which talked about the problems borrowers experienced when repaying student loans with high interest rates. The report also talked about the limited alternative repayment options, including refinancing, that are currently available to borrowers.

When we talk about refinancing a student loan, we generally mean taking out a new education loan with better terms and using it to pay off existing student debt. Refinancing your student loan could help you take advantage of any improvements in your credit profile that have occurred since you were a student, as well as todayâ€™s historically low interest rates. You would be able to lower your monthly payments and put the savings toward a financial goal, like starting a retirement plan or a small business.
